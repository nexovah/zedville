# Zedville — Refactor & Fix Planning (Controllers / Services / Providers / Kernel)

Sequenced by risk/impact. Each phase is independently shippable — don't start phase N+1 until phase N is merged and verified, since later phases assume earlier fixes are in place. No functionality should change as a *side effect* of refactors in Phase 2-4; only Phase 1 changes behavior (it's bug fixes).

## Phase 0 — Verify before touching anything (no code changes)

1. Confirm actual `role` column values on `users` table (int codes like `4` vs string `'student'`) — resolves `bugs.md` #8. Check migration + a `php artisan tinker` sample row.
2. Confirm whether `routes/admin.php` self-applies the `admin` middleware anywhere — resolves `bugs.md` #6. If not, this is a live authorization gap; escalate immediately regardless of refactor timeline.
3. Confirm the correct canonical monthly salary figure (`3952.40` vs `4250`) with product owner — resolves `bugs.md` #13.
4. Confirm the correct academic-year start month — resolves `bugs.md` #12.
5. Grep whether `EFDController`'s `spending_tracker_basicco/stationary/citymall` methods are still referenced by any route/view before deleting (`bugs.md` #18).

## Phase 1 — Critical/High bug fixes (behavior-changing, ship individually, each with a test)

Do these one at a time, each as its own PR, each verified against a real login → salary → bill-deduction flow before merge.

1. **Fix the ledger split** (`bugs.md` #1): point `BankController::creditMonthlySalary()` at `Transaction1` instead of `Transaction`, matching the column shape used everywhere else (`transaction_date`, `type`, `category`, `amount`, `balance`, `bank_account_id`, `sid`). Verify: credit salary, confirm it appears in the same balance chain `ensureMonthlyBills` reads from, confirm bills deduct correctly afterward.
2. **Add missing imports** (`bugs.md` #3, #4): `use App\Models\Mailbox;` in `CitizenActivationController.php`; `use App\Helpers\MailboxScheduler;` in `AdminStudentController.php`. Trivial, but verify the code paths that call them actually execute without error afterward (write a quick feature test hitting `authorize_direct_deposit` and `add_student`).
3. **Move salary/bills off login-trigger onto a real schedule** (`bugs.md` #2): create an Artisan command (e.g. `students:process-monthly-finances`) that chunks over active students and calls `StatementGenerator::generateForUser()` / the bill-posting logic on the correct day-of-month, idempotently (reuse the existing "already processed this month" guards). Schedule it in `Console/Kernel.php` with `->dailyAt(...)` (checking day-of-month inside the command) rather than depending on user login. Keep the login-triggered call as a redundant safety net during transition, remove once the scheduled job is proven reliable for 1-2 full months in production.
4. **Fix badge scheduling** (`bugs.md` #7): change `monthlyOn(31, ...)` to `lastDayOfMonth(...)`.
5. **Wrap balance mutations in transactions with row locks** (`bugs.md` #5): standardize on a small helper — e.g. `BalanceService::withLockedBalance($userId, callable $fn)` that opens `DB::transaction()`, does `Transaction1::where('user_id',$userId)->latest('id')->lockForUpdate()->first()`, and hands the balance to the callback. Migrate `EFDController::storeDonation`, `OrderController::placeOrder`, `ProfileController::storesurvey` onto it one at a time, each with a concurrency-oriented test (two rapid requests, assert no overdraft).
6. **Resolve admin middleware gap** (`bugs.md` #6) — once Phase 0 step 2 confirms the gap is real, add `admin` middleware to the `RouteServiceProvider` admin group (or per-route in `admin.php`, whichever the existing pattern favors). Treat as security-priority, don't wait for the rest of Phase 1.
7. **Decide and resolve the dead penalty trigger** (`bugs.md` #9) — get a product decision (enable or delete), implement accordingly.

## Phase 2 — Structural extraction (no behavior change, pure refactor, needs regression coverage first)

Before starting Phase 2, get baseline test coverage (feature tests) around: login flow, salary credit, bill posting, order placement, donation, survey submission. Refactors below must not change observable behavior — verify via these tests before/after each step.

1. **Extract a `LedgerService`** wrapping the "get latest `Transaction1` balance" pattern (used 13+ places per `ProjectArchitecture.md` §4) into one method: `LedgerService::currentBalance($userId)`, `LedgerService::post($userId, $type, $category, $amount, $description, ...)`. Migrate call sites incrementally (one controller per PR), each verified against existing behavior.
2. **Extract fixed-bill posting** into one method (currently duplicated 3-4x across `CitizenActivationController`, `AuthenticatedSessionController::ensureMonthlyBills`, `BankController`) — e.g. `LedgerService::postMonthlyFixedBills($userId, $bankAccountId, Carbon $forDate)`. This directly supports Phase 1 step 3's scheduled command.
3. **Add a `SetSelectedSchool` middleware** (or a global model scope) to replace the ~40+ manual `session('selected_school')` reads scattered through `AdminEducationController` and siblings. Bind the resolved school onto the request/container once per request instead of re-reading session in every method.
4. **Fix `sid` provenance** (`bugs.md` #14): replace `session('sid')` writes with `$user->sid` (or the bank account's `sid`) at the point of transaction creation, once `LedgerService::post()` exists as the single write path — this becomes a one-line fix inside that service instead of a multi-file find-replace.
5. **Consolidate Civic Chamber** (`bugs.md` #10) into one `CivicChamberService`, called from both `EFDController` (student) and `Admin/CivicChamberController` (admin), each keeping their own thin controller methods but sharing validation/business rules.
6. **Introduce Laravel policies** for the admin/tutor/student checks currently duplicated ad hoc (`ClosetController::requireAdmin`, inline `$user->role == 4` checks). Register in `AuthServiceProvider::$policies`. Don't remove the `IsAdmin` route middleware — policies handle in-controller/resource-level checks, middleware handles route-level.

## Phase 3 — Larger consolidations (bigger risk, plan as dedicated initiatives, not incidental to other work)

1. **Evaluate the two badge systems** (`bugs.md` #11): confirm with product whether both "Engagement Badge" and "FinHero Badge" are still both required. If yes, extract a shared `BadgeEngine` service parameterized by badge-type config (thresholds, categories, level names) so future rule changes apply once. If one is legacy, plan deprecation separately — this is a product decision, not just a refactor.
2. **Consolidate the triplicated supermarket/spending-tracker listing logic** (`SupermarketController`, `SpendingActivitiesController`, and the dead copies in `EFDController`) into one parameterized controller/service, once Phase 0 step 5 confirms the `EFDController` copies are safe to delete first.
3. **Centralize config**: create `config/zedville.php` (or similar) holding monthly salary, emergency-fund %, rent, school fees, academic-year-start-month, badge thresholds — replacing every hardcoded literal identified in `bugs.md` #12/#13 and `ProjectArchitecture.md` §10. Do this after Phase 0 verification steps resolve which values are actually canonical.
4. **Break up the largest controllers** (`BankController` 2377 LOC, `ProfileController` 1324 LOC, `AdminEducationController` 1114 LOC) into narrower controllers + services, guided by the method-boundary findings already listed in `bugs.md`/`ProjectArchitecture.md`. Do this only after Phase 2's `LedgerService`/`SetSelectedSchool` extractions land, since those remove a large fraction of what makes these controllers fat.

## Phase 4 — Cleanup (any time, low risk, keep isolated from functional PRs)

1. Delete all dead/commented-out code blocks listed in `bugs.md` #16, in one or more dedicated "remove dead code" PRs — never mixed into a functional change, so reviewers can diff cleanly.
2. Delete the self-acknowledged dead triplicate methods in `EFDController` (`bugs.md` #18) once Phase 0 step 5 confirms no references remain.
3. Batch-fix naming typos (`bugs.md` #17) — for DB column renames (`backaccountnumber`), this needs a migration + full call-site audit, do NOT rename casually; for pure PHP identifier typos (`emmengercyfundintrest`), safe to fix with a project-wide search.
4. Re-enable or remove the inert "don't repeat quiz questions" logic in `LoginQuizController` (`bugs.md` #15) — needs a product call on whether the feature is wanted.

## Ground rules for whoever executes this plan

- No PR should combine a bug fix with a refactor — reviewers need to tell "behavior change" from "same behavior, cleaner code" at a glance.
- Every Phase 1 item needs a test that would have caught the original bug, not just a manual smoke check.
- Do not touch DB schema/migrations as part of any Phase 1-3 item unless explicitly called out (only the column-rename item in Phase 4 touches schema, and it's flagged as needing special care).
- Re-run the verification steps in Phase 0 whenever revisiting this plan after a gap in time — the codebase may have moved since this audit.

See `bugs.md` for the full defect list this plan resolves, and `ProjectArchitecture.md` for system context.
